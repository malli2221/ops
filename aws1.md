Aws :

1.Create a vpc through wizard, having one public subnet and one private subnet.

Create one vpc, after that create public and private subnets under that vpc.



2.Create two instances within the vpc that you created in task 1, windows instance in public subnet and linux instance in private subnet. check if linux is pingable from windows and vice versa.

I created one vpc, under that vpc i created one subnet has private and one subnet has public, as well as i created routing and internetgate, using that public and private i created two instance one is linux server onther one is windows server, windows created in public and linux created in private, after that login to windows server i try ping yo linux getting timeout error.
